grenedalf is a collection of commands for working with population genetic data.

Many commands in grenedalf are re-implementations of commands of the
[PoPoolation](https://sourceforge.net/projects/popoolation/) and
[PoPoolation2](https://sourceforge.net/projects/popoolation2/) tools.
However, being written in C++, grenedalf is much faster and needs less memory for most of the tasks.
